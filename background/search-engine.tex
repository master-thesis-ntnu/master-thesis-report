\section{Search Engine}
A common approach for search engines is to use \textit{term frequency} (TF) and \textit{inverse document frequency} (IDF) to calculate a document\'s relevance based on a query.
Documents with the highest TF from a query are believed to be the most relevant.
On the other hand, the most common words are removed as they do not contain information about the topic.
TF and IDF alone is a simple model, and Elasticsearch uses a more sophisticated model.
Elasticsearch's document scoring model is described in the following subsections.
This section describes how Elasticsearch scores its documents and is based on the documentation found on the website \cite{elasticsearch-scoring}.

\subsection{Term Frequency}
Term frequency is the number of times a term is mentioned in a document.
A document containing a term multiple times is probably more relevant than a document containing fewer occurences.
However, in this work a term is only present one time in each document, and the reason is described in greater detail in Chapter \ref{ch:approach}.
Term frequency calculation is given by Equation \ref{eq:term-frequency}.

\begin{cequation}[H]
	\begin{equation}
		\mathbf{tf} = \sqrt{frequency}
	\end{equation}
	\caption{Term frequency calculation in Elasticsearch.}
  \label{eq:term-frequency}
\end{cequation}

\subsection{Inverse Document Frequency}
Inverse document frequency describes how many times a term is present in all the documents.
Terms with high frequencies are often less relevant.
E.g. the terms "a" and "an" often appears in a sentence but should not be given a high score even though they appear numerous times.
\begin{cequation}[H]
	\begin{equation}
		\mathbf{idf} = 1 + \log{[\frac{numDocs}{docFrequency + 1}]}
	\end{equation}
	\caption{Inverse Document Frequency calculation in Elasticsearch.}
  \label{eq:idf}
\end{cequation}

\subsection{Document Normalization}
A title field is likely to be shorter compared to a description field.
As a result, the description field possibly contains more instances of a given term.
To account for longer fields document normalization is used.
Elasticsearch's implementation is illustrated in equation \ref{eq:normalization}.

\begin{cequation}[H]
	\begin{equation}
		\mathbf{normalization} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{numTerms}}
	\end{equation}
	\caption{Normalization.}
  \label{eq:normalization}
\end{cequation}

\subsection{Document Score}
\label{sec:doc-score}
After calculating term frequency, inverse document frequency and document normalization all the factors are multiplied together.
A documents score in Elasticsearch is given by the Equation \ref{eq:document-score}.

\begin{cequation}[H]
	\begin{equation}
		\mathbf{documentScore} = tf \times idf \times normalization
	\end{equation}
	\caption{Final document score.}
  \label{eq:document-score}
\end{cequation}

\subsection{Multiple Term Query}
The document score function described in Section \ref{sec:doc-score} is only used when searching for a single term.
While a term query containing multiple terms requires a combination of techniques.
A multiple term query inside Lucene combines the following techniques:
boolean model, TF/IDF and vector space model.
Equation \ref{eq:scoring-function} shows how each document are scored against a multiterm query.
Table \ref{tbl:scoring-function} explaines each variable in equation \ref{eq:scoring-function}.
A more in depth explanation is available at Elasticsearch's documentation\footnote{\url{https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/practical-scoring-function.html}}.

\begin{cequation}
	\begin{equation}
		\begin{aligned}
			\mathbf{score(q,d)} = & coord(q,d) \times queryNorm(q) \\
														& \times \sum tf(t in d) \times idf(t)^2 \times t.getBoost() \times norm(t,d)
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}
