On Elastic's offical website there is a discussion about devoloping plugins for Elasticsearch.
The quote below is an answer from the Elastic developer Adrien Grand on wheter there exists an offical guide on how to develop Elasticsearch plugins \cite{elasticsearch-plugin-quote}.

\begin{quote}
  No, there is no guide about writing plugins and the API is actually quite unstable.
  The plugin API is mainly a way for us to provide additional functionality through plugins so that we do not have to fold everything into a single release artifact that would be quite huge.
  Some community membors have writter plugins by taking inspiration of existing plugins but we do not want to commit on a stable API for plugins as this might prevent us from improving other areas of elasticsearch.
