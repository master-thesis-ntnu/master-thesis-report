On Elastic's offical website there is a discussion about devoloping plugins for Elasticsearch.
The quote below is an answer from the Elastic developer Adrien Grand on wheter there exists an offical guide on how to develop Elasticsearch plugins \cite{elasticsearch-plugin-quote}.

\begin{quote}
  No, there is no guide about writing plugins and the API is actually quite unstable.
  The plugin API is mainly a way for us to provide additional functionality through plugins so that we do not have to fold everything into a single release artifact that would be quite huge.
  Some community membors have writter plugins by taking inspiration of existing plugins but we do not want to commit on a stable API for plugins as this might prevent us from improving other areas of elasticsearch.

The project report \cite{project-report} used aggregation to retrieve information.
Aggregation have two important downsides,
aggregations may consume a great deal of memory,
and aggregations are approximations may not necessarily return the correct value.
Another important downside described in the project report is that the aggregation may
In the implementation described in this thesis the aggregations are removed

- Talk about aggregation memory requirement from project report

- How much slower is the results

- Dont have personalized search in the same way as Rudihagen's master thesis

- Google experiments shows that response times is more important compared to result size
