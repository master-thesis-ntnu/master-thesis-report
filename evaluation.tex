\section{Experimental Setup}

\subsection{Lucene Experiment}
The Lucene experiments starts to build the index with all the photo data.
To make the experiment simpler only the fields: tags, title and url are stored.

\subsection{Elasticsearch Experiment}
The Elasticsearch experimental setup contains two main components, the node server and the Elasticsearch server.

\subsection{Performance Metrics}

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
The results from the experiments in the project report [??],
showed that the query expansion implementation had about 2 times longer latency compared to the baseline implementation.
The latency were measured from the request left the user to the response from the server arrived.

All the results show that the first request is often the slowest.
After the initial request the respons is cached by Lucene and makes all the subsequent requests a lot faster.

\subsection{Lucene Results}
About 50\% increased latency with the Lucene implementation.
Can see that Lucene heavily caches search result.
The first initial results often is a lot slower than the subsequent searces.
