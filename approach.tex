\label{ch:approach}
The initial implementation described in the project report [??] were implemented on a server backend.
This approach re

\section{Architecture}
The first implementation utilizes Lucene directly.
However, Lucene alone is not scalable.

\subsection{Lucene Architecture}
Most search engines strives to hold the data in memory.
To achieve the performance desired by Lucene the whole index is kept in memory.
