\chapter{Approach}
\label{ch:approach}
After implementing query expansion in the project report,
the though were to implement query expansion directly into the search engine.
As the Elasticsearch source code are poorly documented the choice were to implement query expansion with Lucene and then later port it into Elasticsearch.
After the implementing query expansion using Lucene,
Elasticsearch's documentation were inspected on how to make the implementation scalable.
It were discovered that Elasticsearch has a plugin API which can be used to extend Elasticsearch's functionallity.

This chapter gives an overview of the query expansion algorithm before the implementation with Lucene and Elasticsearch is explained.
