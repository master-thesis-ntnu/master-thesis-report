\chapter{Implementing Query Expansion in a Search Engine}
\label{ch:approach}
After implementing query expansion in the project report,
the challenge was to implement query expansion directly into the search engine.
As the Elasticsearch source code is poorly documented,
the choice was to implement query expansion with Lucene and then finally port it into Elasticsearch.
After implementing query expansion using Lucene,
Elasticsearch's documentation was inspected to learn how to make the implementation scalable.
It was discovered that Elasticsearch has a plugin API which can be used to extend Elasticsearch's functionality.

This chapter gives an overview of the query expansion algorithm before the implementation with Lucene and Elasticsearch is explained.
