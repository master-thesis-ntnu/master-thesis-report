\subsection{Lucene Architecture}
\cite{lucene-documentation}
Most search engines strives to hold the data in memory.
To achieve the performance desired by Lucene the whole index is kept in memory.

The tag field is stored with information about document frequency for each term.
The document frequency is required to calculate the KL score for each term.

Minimal Java optimizations

Even though the Lucen implementation delivered promising results, Lucene in itself is not scalable.
As one of the research questions

\subsubsection{Lucene Notes}
- Discuss java methods to retrieve term frequency from the inverted index
