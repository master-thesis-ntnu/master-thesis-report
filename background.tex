\chapter{Background}
\label{ch:background}
This chapter presents basic theory and techniques behind search engines. First
the technologies used in the implementation are explained, and then followed by a
detailed description on how the documents are scored inside the search engine from a
query. Finally, relevance feedback is described as well as how it may be used in an query
expansion.

\section{Open Source Search Engine Solutions}
Making large amounts of data available for users to search requires speialized search engines.

At the time of writing there exists open source alternatives like Elasticsearch\footnote{\url{https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch}},
Solr\footnote{\url{http://lucene.apache.org/solr/}} and Xapian\footnote{\url{https://xapian.org/}}.

Some of the search engines contains query expansion implementations,
but they are limited to synonyms expansion.
None of the open source databases deliver personalized search capabilities.

\section{Notes}
- Personalized search Google https://googleblog.blogspot.no/2009/12/personalized-search-for-everyone.html
- Some of the queries from Elasticsearch returns estimated values (aggregations). Important because of performance. Queries is distributed across multiple nodes.
