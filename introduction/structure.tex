\section{Structure}
This master thesis consists of 5 chapters: Background, State of the Art Survey, Approach, Evaluation and a Conclusion.
The \hyperref[ch:background]{Background} chapter starts with an overview of the underlying technologies used in the implementation.
Furthermore, this chapter contains sections which describe basic search engine techniques, relevance feedback and query expansion.
The chapter \hyperref[ch:related-work]{State of the Art Survey} describes related reasearch on how to improve result relevance.
The theoretical basis for this master thesis is also included in this chapter.
The chapter \hyperref[ch:approach]{Approach} describes the implementation in Lucene and the implemented Elasticsearch implementation.
Important configurations are also described.
Next, the chapter \hyperref[ch:evaluation]{Evaluation} outlines how the experiments were conducted and the results from the experiments.
The last section discusses the results and makes a comparison with the work by Rudihagen \cite{master-thesis} and the project report by Lund \cite{project-report}.
Lastly, the \hyperref[ch:conclusion]{Conclusion} chapter gives a brief summary of the results and the implementation.
The last section suggests further work that, if implemented, will improve the current implementation.
